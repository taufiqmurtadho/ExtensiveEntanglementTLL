## Extensive Entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium

This repository contains the source code for calculating the results of Ref. [1], where we investigate the entanglement and mutual information between two parallel
1D Bose gases at two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting.
